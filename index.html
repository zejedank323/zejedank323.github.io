<h2>Experience</h2>
<ul class="nav flex-column">
  <li>Carlsberg (2016 - 2019)</p>
    <div class="px-4">
      <p> Sales consultant at Carlsberg group Denmark. The experience has been very good, as I liked working with the task of satisfying our clients at my best. </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Ejvind Laursen (2014 - Now)</p>
    <div class="px-4">
      <p>I took contact to a local entrepreneur in Hedensted, who was in need of a digitalized wage system. The system
        is a simple Web page which allows the individual worker to submit their work for the day.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>SuperBrugsen Hedensted (2011 – 2015)</p>
    <div class="px-4">
      <p> In my time at SuperBrugsen Hedensted, have I experienced multiple promotions, starting as a service employee.
        After four months was I promoted to the Service desk, and later a full-time contract. Doing my education at HTX,
        I managed to work 15 hours a week.
        Separated from my work I developed a platform, allowing Superbrugsen to digitally share product deals on screens
        within the store. I built this system as a simple static web page with Javascript. SuperBrugsen is still using
        this system today.
